    "\n",
    "Throughout the Modules, you have found a dataset, characterized the corresponding goals and tasks you want to conduct with that data, designed preliminary approaches, and outlined how you would evaluate those approaches. For your final project, you will put these ideas into practice by executing on the project plan outlined in your prior posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you will implement a visualization using your data from Module 1 and preliminary low-fidelity prototypes from Module 2 to address your stated goals. You may implement this visualization using either Altair or another platform of your choice. Once implemented, conduct your evaluation based on the plan outlined in your Module 3 discussion post, making sure to conduct your evaluation with at least three people. You may refine any of your prior plan to reflect your evolving understanding of the challenges you are addressing. Be sure to address how your plan has changed from these earlier posts as part of your discussion. \n",

    "### Your final project post should include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A brief recap of your data, goals, and tasks, focusing on those that most directly influence your design\n",
    "- Screenshots of and/or a link to your visualization implementation (see below for additional guidance)\n",
    "- A summary of the key elements of your design and accompanying justification\n",
    "- A discussion of your final evaluation approach, including the procedure, people recruited, and results. Note that, due to the difficulty of recruiting experts, you can use colleagues, friends, classmates, or family to evaluate your designs if experts or others from your target population are unavailable.\n",
